There's a difference between building systems and building meaning. I've spent the last two decades doing both--sometimes at the same time, often in conflict with each other.

**Connstruct** isn't just a portfolio. It's a statement. A declaration that ethics *matter*, even in tech. Especially in tech.

## Who I Am

I'm a systems engineer by trade, a security professional by experience, and a builder by instinct. I served in the U.S. military for seven years, supporting combat operations across hostile environments. I cut my teeth securing infrastructure that needed to *just work*--not in a lab, not in theory, but in places where failure had consequences.

That background never left me. It shaped how I think, how I lead, and how I design. I hold the line on integrity, precision, and pragmatism--not because they look good in a résumé, but because people's lives *used to depend on it*.

## What Matters to Me

**Accountability. Privacy. Autonomy.**

I believe in building systems that empower people--not exploit them.

I don't work for surveillance firms. I won't build infrastructure for authoritarian regimes. I don't believe in trading user freedom for corporate convenience. I've seen where that road leads. It's not a path I'll ever walk again.

I believe in the right to compute in peace. To speak, to think, to build, without being watched. I believe zero-trust architecture should serve the *user's* safety--not the surveillance state.

And I believe in *earning* trust, not demanding it.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm looking for work that matters--work that doesn't just *function*, but *stands for something*. I want to contribute to systems that protect people, elevate their voices, and resist coercion. Projects that aren't afraid to draw a line in the sand.

If you're building tech for good--*real* good, not marketing-deck good--I want to help. If you value resilience over trend-chasing, signal over noise, freedom over control… then we already speak the same language.

This site will be part blueprint, part field journal. Expect engineering breakdowns, secure design writeups, and the occasional firebrand essay when the state of tech demands one. I've got a lot to say, and this is the first time I've given myself the space to say it.

Welcome to **Connstruct**.

Let's build something worth building.
