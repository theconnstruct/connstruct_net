I'm Connor. I'm not in the military anymore, but it never left me.

I came up in military IT, supporting combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. I wasn't trained for a narrow role. I was thrown into situations where things were broken, time was short, lives were on the line, and someone had to figure it out. That someone was usually me.

I poured everything I had into that workâ€”not because it was my job, but because I believed in it. I built systems that held under pressure. I watched messages move across networks I built, knowing those messages meant someone got backup, someone got extracted, someone got to go home. That kind of work changes you. You don't forget what it feels like to matter.

I've never cared about rank or job titles. I care about building systems that don't fail when it counts. Systems that assume nothing, trust nothing by default, and survive the worst-case scenario. Systems that you can rely on when it all goes sideways.

What I bring isn't just technical depth. It's ownership. It's knowing what it means to be the last line. It's living with the responsibility of building the thing that can't break.

This isn't what I do. **This is who I am.**
